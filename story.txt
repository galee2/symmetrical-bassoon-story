Once upon a time there was a bassoon named Marty. 
Marty, however, was unlike all the other bassoons. He was symmetrical. 
This was quite unfortunate, as this meant he could not play the same music 
as everyone else. So he had trouble making friend with the other bassoons.

Marty attempted to make friends by telling jokes. No one found Marty's jokes funny and he began to cry. Marty decided since he can't make any friends that he is going travel somewhere far.   

So, Marty packed his bags and threw a dart at the map in his home. The dart landed on Hawaii. "Great" he thougt, at least it'll be warm there, and away he went.
